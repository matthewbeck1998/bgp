# BGP Compiler
Built for CS 460, Dr. Frederick Calvin Harris, Jr's Compiler Construction course by Matthew Beck, William Garner, and Price Poston.

## Quick Start
Here are the quick and dirty instructions for getting some 3AC output to examine.\
If your name is **Chris Koh** or **Derek Stratton**, you are required to read these instructions twice.\
This is due to the fact that neither of you can follow instructions.

**Linux**
1. Make sure you are in the bgp directory.
2. Compile the code with ```make -C src```.
3. Run ```./bin/bgp input/forLoop.c``` to see 3AC for a for loop.
4. Run ```./bin/bgp input/whileLoop.c``` to see 3AC for a while loop.
5. Run ```./bin/bgp input/doWhileLoop.c``` to see 3AC for a do while loop.

**Windows**
1. Make sure you are in the bgp directory.
2. Compile the code with ```make -C src```.
3. Run ```bin\bgp.exe input/forLoop.c``` to see 3AC for a for loop.
4. Run ```bin\bgp.exe input/whileLoop.c``` to see 3AC for a while loop.
5. Run ```bin\bgp.exe input/doWhileLoop.c``` to see 3AC for a do while loop.

Please note that the 3AC for all three of the inputs are exactly the same.\
This is due to the fact that all three of the inputs should indeed be the same program written in three different ways.\
Other test cases can be found in the input directory within the bgp directory (the bgp directory is the one you are in at step 1).

## Running bgp

**Linux**
1. Make sure you are in the bgp directory.
2. Compile the code with ```make -C src```.
3. Run the program using ```./bin/bgp inputFileName``` where inputFileName is the name of the input file. There are optional command line arguments "-o", "-d", "-s", "-l", and "-p". "-o" must be followed by an output filename.
4. Get the image of the Abstract Syntax Tree by using ```make graph -C src```.

Example:\
Your desired input file: ```input/forLoop.c```\
Your desired output file: ```output/forLoop.dat```\
Your desired flags: ```-d -p -o```\
Command: ```./bin/bgp input/forLoop.c -d -p -o output/forLoop.dat```\
Graph: ```make graph -C src```\
You can find the AST visualization in ```output/ASTree.png```.

**Windows**
1. Make sure you are in the bgp directory.
2. Compile the code with ```make -C src```.
3. Run the program using ```bin\bgp.exe input/inputFileName``` where inputFileName is the name of the input file. There are optional command line arguments "-o", "-d", "-s", "-l", and "-p". "-o" must be followed by an output filename.
4. Get the image of the Abstract Syntax Tree by using ```make graph -C src```.

Example:\
Your desired input file: ```input/forLoop.c```\
Your desired output file: ```output/forLoop.dat```\
Your desired flags: ```-d -p -o```\
Command: ```bin\bgp.exe input/forLoop.c -d -p -o output/forLoop.dat```\
Graph: ```make graph -C src```\
You can find the AST visualization in ```output/ASTree.png```.
